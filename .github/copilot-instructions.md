# Instructions entrypoint

## Rules files

All rules to be followed are listed here. The assistant will follow these rules when generating code.

- `.vscode/rules/code-standards.instructions.md` - Code standards and conventions
- `.vscode/rules/design-system.instructions.md` - Design system and concepts to follow when implementing new components
- `.vscode/rules/important-files.instructions.md` - Important files to be aware of

These files should be referenced when applying changes to the codebase.

- update the rules files when needed, either prompted by the user or when you see a need for it
