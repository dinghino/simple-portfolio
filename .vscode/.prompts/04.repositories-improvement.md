# Improving projects section

Our fetched repositories are a bit too basic. we want to improve how they appear in the page.

## Tasks

- extract the language fetching from the `githubRepoToProject` adapter function and move it to `gihub/api.ts`
- add the new function to the default export of the api module
- refactor data/projects.ts exported list of repositories to fetch to be a `Record<string, Partial<Project>>`
- refactor fetch functions, extractor and adapter so that we can override fetched data with the information in the partial record
- make `githubRepo` property optional in the `Project` type
- adjust components (section and project-card) accordingly to the new data structure

## Additional information

- the `githubRepoToProject` should ONLY transform the data from the API to our local `Project` type.
- use `Promise.all` whenever possible
- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.vscode/rules/rules.important-files.md` file.
- In case of doubt or multiple options, check with the user for suggestions and ideas.
- you can use the `api` export from the `lib/github` module to access our custom wrapper functions.
