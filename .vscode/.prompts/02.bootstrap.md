## Problem

Our personal portfolio website is currently just a basic Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. we need to start adding functionality to the project and sections to the website.

## Design information

- We are creating a personal portfolio website for myself. We are aiming for a sleek, modern, minimalistic and flat design.
- We are thinking something that evokes a theme of coding and technology, with references to the web and actual code, with "comments" and "code" being the main elements of the design.
- We are using a dark theme, with a light theme as a fallback. for now we can use `dim` as the dark theme and `silk` for the light theme, from daisyui.
- We are using a font that is a mix of monospace and sans-serif, with a modern look.

- We do not want shadows or rounded corners, we want a flat design.
- We want to use bold and large text for the main elements of the design, and smaller text for the secondary elements.
- We want to use a lot of whitespace, and a lot of padding to separate the sections of the website.

## Supporting Information

### Components

- We are using DaisyUI for the components, and Tailwind CSS for the styling and `clsx` and `cva` for the classnames
- We want to have reusable consistent components with variants
  - these components should be in `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/sections/`

### Website structure

- Main focus should be on the home page, with a simple navigation bar at the top.
- The home page should have a hero section, with a title, a subtitle, and a call to action button.
- The home page should have a section for my projects, with a list of my projects and a link to each project.
- Each project will be shown in a grid layout cell with the project name, description, link to the repostory and optionally a link to the deployed project.
  - These cells are to be considered as "cards" but with a flat design, no shadows or rounded corners.
- The home page should have a section for my skills, with a list of my skills and a link to each skill.
  - Skills should be data driven and stored in `/src/data/`.
- Home page should have a footer section, with links to my social media profiles and a copyright notice.

### Octokit

We are using Octokit to interact with GitHub, from where we will get up to date information about my projects, my repositories, my issues, my pull requests, etc.
We are using a data driven approach to the content, storing relevant static information in a `/src/data/repositories` folder.

Data stored in this folder will be used to select which repositories to show on the website, and which information to show about them.

- Octokit methods should be put in their own file, in `src/github/<file-name>.ts`.

```ts
import { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });
```

Environment variables can be put in a `.env` file.

#### Octokit methods

- We can create a local simpler API for our next.js app, using the octokit library to interact with GitHub.
- Create helper functions and hooks in `src/github/*.ts`

## Steps To Complete

- Ensure that `.env` is added to the `.gitignore` file.
- Get the user to add a GitHub token to `.env`.
- Ensure that `.env` is being loaded into the environment when running the `dev` script.
- Install `octokit` as a dependency if missing.
- Discuss with the user about the structure and layout of the website.
- Discuss with the user any other detail that might be relevant to the design of the website.
- Create a new file in `.vscode/rules` defining what components and sections are required
- Create a new file in `.vscode/rules` defining what data is required for the website.
- Create a new file in `.vscode/rules` defining the design system for the website so that you - copilot - can use it to create the components and sections.
- Create the initial folder structure and some basic components with the required variants, sections and pages.
- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.vscode/rules/important-files.md` file.
