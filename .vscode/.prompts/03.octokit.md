# Adding github repositories

## Problem

Currently our projects are hardcoded in our codebase. we want to use `octokit` (already installed) to fetch and show up to date information about some projects.

The idea is to have a few hardcoded projects that, for various reasons need to be set up manually, and have a configuration file with a list of repositories that we want
to fetch and show dynamically on the website.

## Existing code

- `components/project-card` card component that can be used to show individual projects
- `components/sections/projects`: server component, handling data fetching and layout
- `data/projects.ts`: currently mocking projects. will contain the list of repository names to fetch and the list of `Project`s to manually set up

## Tasks

- `lib/github/` module
  This module will contain all the logic to interact with github through `octokit`.
  - `client.ts`: contain the client setup
  - `api.ts`: simple api wrapper around octokit to fetch repositories
  - `adapter.ts`: convert the data from octokit to our `Project` type
  - barrel export for the package, including a default export for the client

- `data/projects.ts`: add an export for an array of repository names to fetch from github. leave it empty for now.
- update the `projects` section to SSR fetch the data with octokit, transform it and merge it with the static data from `data/projects.ts`

## Supporting Information

- types are available in the `@/types/` folder
- we have some old code in a root `.ignore` folder. as the name of the folder suggests, ignore that completely.
- Ensure that all major files are added to the `.vscode/rules/rules.important-files.md` file.
- In case of doubt or multiple options, check with the user for suggestions and ideas.

## Issues

- We have some authentication issues with octokit, even though the access token is present. Suggest the user how to properly set up the access token on github and what permissions to give it.
