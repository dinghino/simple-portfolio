# Portfolio Website Setup

## Problem

We want to set up a new personal portfolio website, written in TypeScript and hosted on Vercel.
We are starting from a basic bootstrap project created with `npx create-next-app@latest .`.

We are writing this in Cursor, so recording the important files in a `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file is important.
We need to set up the basic file system for the project, install necessary dependencies, and set up the project structure.

## Supporting Information

### Tools

#### `pnpm`

Use `pnpm` as the package manager.

### File Structure

Recommended file structure:

#### `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc`

A file that lists the important files for the project, which should be included in every chat.

Use the `mdc` format, which is a markdown format with these frontmatter fields:

```md
---
globs: **/**
alwaysApply: true
---

...content goes here...
```

Make sure to add a directive at the end of the file that if new files are added, they should be added to the `important-files.mdc` file.

#### `package.json`

Dependencies:

These are some of the core dependencies that we will need. check the `package.json` and install what is missing.

- `zod`: A schema declaration and validation library for TypeScript.
- `daisyui`: A library of components for building websites.
- `lucide-react`: A library of icons for building websites.
- `simple-icons`: A library of icons for building websites including businesses logos.
- `class-variance-authority`: A library for managing class names in a more predictable way.
- `clsx`: A library for managing class names in a more predictable way.
- `tailwind-merge`: A library for merging tailwind classes in a more predictable way.
- `tailwindcss-animate`: A library for animating tailwind classes in a more predictable way.
- `octokit`: A library for interacting with the GitHub API.

#### `.gitignore`

A file that lists the files to ignore in the project. `dist` should be ignored since it is the output directory.

## Steps To Complete

- create a `.cursor/rules/important-files.mdc` file that lists the important files for the project.
- create another `.mdc` file that will be used to keep track of important code rules and standards for the project.
- Use a `pnpm add` command to install the dependencies so that they are pinned to the current version. Do NOT use `latest` or `next`.
- setup `daisyui` in the project following the documentation.
- Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server once the project is set up.
